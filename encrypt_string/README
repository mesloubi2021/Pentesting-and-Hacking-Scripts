## Encrypt String Script

This script provides the capability 
to hash strings using various hashing
algorithms, making it useful for 
encryption and security purposes. 
The following hashing algorithms 
are supported:

1. SHA224
2. SHA256
3. SHA512
4. SHA1 
5. MD5
6. BLAKE2S
7. BLAKE2B

Input is accepted through a text file (not a binary)
The hashed string is written in a file named "hashed.txt" in the present working directory.


## How to Use?
1.Input: The script accepts input through a text file containing the string you want to hash. Please note that it only accepts text files, not binary files.

2.Output: The hashed string is written to a file named "hashed.txt" in the present working directory.


## Running the Script
1.To run the script, follow these steps:

2. Locate the Script: Navigate to the directory where the script is stored.

3. Execute the Script: Use the following command to execute the script:

``
python ./string_hashing.py
``
## Important Note

Hashing is a one-way process, meaning you cannot 
reverse-engineer the original string from the hash. It is commonly 
used for securely storing passwords and verifying data integrity.
